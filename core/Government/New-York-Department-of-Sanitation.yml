description: "DSNY Monthly Tonnage Data provides monthly collection tonnages that the Department of Sanitation collects from NYC residences and institutions. For more information about DSNY services, see: http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dsny/site/services. Please note that in the face of economic hardship, and to ensure the City can continue to devote resources to essential safety, health, shelter, and food security needs, the New York City Department of Sanitation announced the suspension of the curbside composting program, beginning May 4, 2020. During the suspension, any food scraps and yard waste set out for composting will be collected as trash. The suspension is currently planned through June 30, 2021."
