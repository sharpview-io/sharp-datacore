description: A group of scientists at Stanford University have collaborated on a large study to understand genetic diversity in human populations. We analyzed genomic DNA from 1,043 individuals from around the world, determining their genotypes at more than 650,000 SNP loci, with the Illumina BeadStation technology. Genomic DNA samples from these fully-consenting individuals were collected by the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP), in a collaboration with the Centre Etude Polymorphism Humain (CEPH) in Paris. The collection we tested is referred to as the "HGDP-CEPH Human Genome Diversity Cell Line Panel". They represent 51 different populations from Africa, Europe, the Middle East, South and Central Asia, East Asia, Oceania and the Americas.
