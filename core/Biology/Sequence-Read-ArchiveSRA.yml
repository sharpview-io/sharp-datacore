description: The Sequence Read Archive (SRA) stores raw sequence data from "next-generation" sequencing technologies including Illumina, 454, IonTorrent, Complete Genomics, PacBio and OxfordNanopores. In addition to raw sequence data, SRA now stores alignment information in the form of read placements on a reference sequence.
