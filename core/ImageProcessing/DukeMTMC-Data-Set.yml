description: DukeMTMC aims to accelerate advances in multi-target multi-camera tracking. It provides a tracking system that works within and across cameras, a new large scale HD video data set recorded by 8 synchronized cameras with more than 7,000 single camera trajectories and over 2,000 unique identities, and a new performance evaluation method that measures how often a system is correct about who is where.
