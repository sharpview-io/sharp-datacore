homepage: https://arquivos.ufsc.br/d/373be2177a33426a9e6c/
category: ImageProcessing
description: 'The dataset contains 2540 images (1600x1200 where each pixel is 0.111μm×0.111μm) from three different slides, having at least one nucleus per image. These images are from fields belonging to a sample cervical slide, colored with silver-stained, a method known as Argyrophilic Nucleolar Organizer Regions (AgNOR). These images were manually labeled with "objects" of four categories: Nuclei, Clusters, Satellites and Out of Focus. This annotations is available in COCO format, and in images masks.'
